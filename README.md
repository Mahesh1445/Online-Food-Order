# Online-Food-Order
The Online Food Order project is a full-stack web application designed to provide a seamless food ordering experience for customers and efficient order management for restaurants. The system allows users to browse menus, filter items by category, add products to a cart, and securely place orders through an intuitive interface. It includes user authentication, real-time order tracking, and payment integration to ensure a smooth transaction process. On the admin side, the platform supports menu management, order status updates, and customer data handling. Built with a structured backend, database integration, and responsive frontend design, the project demonstrates strong skills in web development, database management, API integration, and scalable application architecture.
